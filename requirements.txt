# Requirements for the doc-to-pdf conversion script
# No external Python dependencies are required for the current script
# as it uses standard libraries (os, subprocess, pathlib).
# LibreOffice must be installed separately for the script to work.

# Optional: Add dependencies here if you extend the project, e.g.:
# comtypes==1.2.0  # For Microsoft Word-based conversion (if used)
